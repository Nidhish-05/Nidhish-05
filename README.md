👋 Hi, I’m Nidhish Bansal
💻 Computer Science undergrad | Developer & Problem Solver
🌐 I work with C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I’m exploring frameworks and full-stack development.
📈 Currently enhancing my Data Structures & Algorithms, while building practical projects that solve real problems.
🧠 Tech, logic, and design fascinate me endlessly – it's not just passion, it’s my way of thinking.
📫 Reach out anytime: nidhishbansal05@gmail.com
✨ Fun fact: I find peace in code and creativity in problem solving. Technology never exhausts me – it fuels me.
